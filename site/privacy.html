        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
          Your data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption. We use reputable
          third-party infrastructure providers with strong security practices. We retain your

        </p>
        <p>
          While we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your
          information, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is

        <p>
          Our apps may integrate with third-party services (such as Apple's native frameworks,
